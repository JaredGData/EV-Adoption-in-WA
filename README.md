EV Adoption in Washington: Where Policy Meets the Grid

Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard analyzes electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends across Washington State using public registration data. It explores geographic distribution, model year trends, fuel type segmentation, and policy alignment to support infrastructure planning and legislative strategy.

Objectives
- Visualize EV registrations by county, city, and postal code
- Segment adoption by fuel type (BEV vs PHEV) and model year
- Identify top brands and models driving market growth
- Analyze CAFV eligibility and legislative district impact
- Support utility-level planning for grid readiness

Key Insights
- **261K EVs registered**, with an average model year of **2022**
- **Tesla, Toyota, and Chevrolet** lead the market; brand diversity is increasing
- **BEVs account for 79.6%** of the fleet, showing a shift toward full electrification
- **Urban counties dominate adoption**, but rural areas show high CAFV eligibility
- **Top districts and utilities** correlate with higher adoption, indicating policy and infrastructure influence


1. Adoption Curve & Fleet Maturity
- Model Year Distribution shows a steep upward trend from 2018 to 2024, with 2022 as the average model year.
- This reflects:
  - Accelerated consumer adoption post-2020, likely due to improved range, incentives, and model availability.
  - A young fleet, which implies lower maintenance needs now but rising demand for service infrastructure in 5–7 years.

**Implication**: Washington is in the growth-to-maturity transition phase of EV adoption. Planning for long-term servicing, battery recycling, and resale markets is critical.

### 2. Geographic Disparities & Infrastructure Gaps
- King County alone accounts for ~50% of all EVs, followed by Snohomish and Pierce.
- Yet counties like Whatcom and Benton show higher CAFV eligibility rates (35–37%), suggesting untapped potential.

**Implication**: Urban areas are saturated and well-incentivized. Rural and mid-tier counties represent the next frontier — ideal for targeted infrastructure investment and outreach.

---

### 3. Fuel Type Shift: BEV vs PHEV
- BEVs make up 79.6% of the fleet, with PHEVs at 20.4%.
- BEV growth has outpaced PHEVs since 2020, indicating:
  - Improved charging confidence
  - Policy alignment with zero-emission goals
  - Consumer preference for simplicity (vs dual-fuel complexity)

**Implication**: Charging infrastructure must scale to match BEV dominance. Utilities should prioritize DC fast charging corridors and home charging incentives.

---

### 4. Legislative District & Utility Influence
- Top districts (41, 45, 48) and utilities (Seattle City Light, Bonneville) correlate with high EV volumes.
- These areas likely benefit from:
  - Pro-EV legislation
  - Utility rebate programs
  - Urban density and affluence

**Implication**: Legislative and utility partnerships are key levers for scaling adoption. District-level dashboards can guide policy targeting and funding allocation.

---

### 5. Brand & Model Dynamics
- Tesla dominates with Model Y and Model 3 leading registrations.
- Toyota leads in hybrids, while Chevrolet and Ford maintain relevance through Bolt and Mach-E.
- Emerging brands like Rivian and Hyundai signal growing diversity.

**Implication**: The market is maturing. Aftermarket services, insurance models, and resale platforms must adapt to a broader brand mix and evolving consumer expectations.

---

### 6. CAFV Eligibility & Equity
- Only 29.35% of vehicles are CAFV-eligible, with 61.5% ineligible and 9.2% unknown.
- This suggests:
  - Awareness or access gaps in incentive programs
  - Potential misalignment between policy design and real-world adoption

**Implication**: CAFV programs need better targeting, clearer eligibility criteria, and localized outreach — especially in high-eligibility, low-adoption counties.
